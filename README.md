Symptoms and Failure-inducing Inputs
Array Methods 
Write down in notes – For each, what was the failure-inducing input (the test)? What was the symptom (the output when the test failed)? What was the bug (the problem in the code)? Be as specific as possible to fill this in: copy the code for your tests, the output for the symptoms, and the code change you need to make for the bug.

Reflect, write down in notes – You’ve now had to create two new test files (one for ListExamples and one for LinkedListExample). What actions did you take in your editor to do this? How long did it take you? Could you or did you use copy/paste effectively to avoid lots of typing? Could you or did you use the up arrow in the terminal to “get back” earlier commands rather than typing them out again? Any other tricks you could use to make this more painless in the future?
